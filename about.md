I am a PostDoctoral Researcher in the [Dynamic Legged System lab](https://dls.iit.it/) at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.  I received my Ph.D (2016) and Msc (2011) in Intelligent Robotics from the University of Edinburgh,  working under the supervision of Prof. Sethu Vijayakumar. Previously, I graduated from the Polytechnic University of Bucharestâ€‰, with a BSc in Engineering in Automatic Control and Applied Informatics.

My research focuses on optimal control, machine learning and using variable impedance actuators for systems in domains with contacts. I am currently working on locomotion strategies for the HyQ robot series.
