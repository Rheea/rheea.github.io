  I am currently the Robotics Research Control Team Techlead at Dyson Technology Ltd. I've joined Dyson in 2019 as a Robotics Research Engineer and have been working on delivering various control technology solution, as driven by the product requirement. Our team works closely with other parts of the research team (mechanical design, electronics, perception, high level planning, safety).
  
  
  Between 2016 - 2019 I was a PostDoctoral Researcher in the [Dynamic Legged Systems Group](https://dls.iit.it) at the Italian Institute of Technology. My research focused on optimal control, machine learning and using variable impedance actuators for systems in domains with contacts. I was working on locomotion strategies for the [HyQ robot series](https://dls.iit.it/robots).
  
  
  I received my Ph.D (2016) and Msc (2011) in Intelligent Robotics from the University of Edinburgh,  working under the supervision of Prof. Sethu Vijayakumar. Previously, I graduated from the Polytechnic University of Bucharestâ€‰, with a BSc in Engineering in Automatic Control and Applied Informatics.
