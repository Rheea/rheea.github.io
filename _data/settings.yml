  ## About Me - [CV](/files/docs/andreea_radulescu_cv.pdf)

  I am currently the Head of Control at [ALL3 Ltd.](https://www.all3.com), where I define and drive the development roadmap for the Mantis robotic platform, focused on automating construction-site operations. I lead the control team responsible for the architecture supporting dynamic locomotion and manipulation across our robotic fleet, while expanding the stack toward reinforcement learning and AI-driven methodologies.


  Previously (2021 - 2024) I was the Robotics Research Control Team Techlead at [Dyson Technology Ltd.](https://careers.dyson.com/en-gb/what-you-can-do/engineer/robotics/). I originally joined Dyson in 2019 as a Robotics Research Engineer and worked on delivering various control technology solution, as driven by the product requirement. The team I lead operated in close collaboration with other parts of the research group (mechanical design, electronics, perception, high level planning, safety).
  
  
  Between 2016 - 2019 I was a PostDoctoral Researcher in the [Dynamic Legged Systems Group](https://dls.iit.it) at the Italian Institute of Technology. My research focused on optimal control, machine learning and using variable impedance actuators for systems in domains with contacts. I was working on locomotion strategies for the [HyQ robot series](https://dls.iit.it/robots).
  
  
  I received my Ph.D (2016) and Msc (2011) in Intelligent Robotics from the University of Edinburgh,  working under the supervision of Prof. Sethu Vijayakumar. Previously, I graduated from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest , with a BEng (2009) in Automatic Control and Applied Informatics.
