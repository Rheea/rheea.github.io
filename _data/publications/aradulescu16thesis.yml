    <td markdown="span"> The control of complex robotic platforms is a challenging task, especially in designs with high 
     levels of kinematic redundancy. Novel variable impedance actuators (VIAs) have recently demonstrated 
     that, by allowing the ability to simultaneously modulate the output torque and impedance, one can 
     achieve energetically more efficient and safer behaviour. However, this adds further levels of 
     actuation redundancy, making planning and control of such systems even more complicated. </td>

    <td markdown="span">VIAs are designed with the ability to mechanically modulate impedance during movement. Recent work 
     from our group, employing the optimal control (OC) formulation to generate impedance policies, has 
     shown the potential benefit of VIAs in tasks requiring energy storage, natural dynamic exploitation 
     and robustness against perturbation. These approaches were, however, restricted to systems with 
     smooth, continuous dynamics, performing tasks over a predefined time horizon. When considering tasks 
     involving multiple phases of movement, including switching dynamics with discrete state transitions 
     (resulting from interactions with the environment), traditional approaches such as independent phase 
     optimisation would result in a potentially suboptimal behaviour.</td>

  <tr>
    <td markdown="span">Our work addresses these issues by extending the OC formulation to a multi-phase scenario and 
     incorporating temporal optimisation capabilities (for robotic systems with VIAs). Given a predefined 
     switching sequence, the developed methodology computes the optimal torque and impedance profile,  
     alongside the optimal switching times and total movement duration. The resultant solution minimises 
     the control effort by exploiting the actuation redundancy and modulating the natural dynamics of the 
     system to match those of the desired movement. We use a monopod hopper and a brachiation system in 
     numerical simulations and a hardware implementation of the latter to demonstrate the effectiveness 
     and robustness of our approach on a variety of dynamic tasks.</td>
